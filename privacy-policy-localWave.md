1) Scope & Purpose

Local Wave is an offline local music player. It plays audio files stored on the user’s device only, with fast scan, instant search, background playback, mini-player, and persistent notification controls. No account, no personal data collection, and no data transmission to external servers.

2) Data Collection & Sharing

We do not collect personal data, nor do we share any data with third parties.

No analytics SDKs, no ad networks, and no tracking.

Metadata shown in the app (track title, artist, album, duration, file path, album art if embedded) is read from local files and used on-device only.

3) On-Device Processing & Storage

Library scanning, search, and audio metadata parsing are performed locally on the device.

App preferences (theme, sort options, notification settings) are stored locally within app storage.

Clearing app data/uninstalling removes local preferences.

4) Permissions and Their Use

Local Wave requests only the permissions required for core playback:

READ_MEDIA_AUDIO (Android 13+): read local audio files to index and play them.

READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (up to Android 12, with maxSdkVersion="32"): access audio files on legacy devices.

POST_NOTIFICATIONS: show playback notifications and controls.

FOREGROUND_SERVICE & FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK: run audio playback as a foreground service with a persistent notification, per Google’s foreground service policy.

The app does not request location, contacts, device identifiers, or “All files access”. No remote code execution is used.

5) Network & Ads

The app does not require internet connectivity and does not provide online streaming or downloads.

No ads and no tracking.

6) Data Security

Since we do not collect or transmit data, security is limited to the device’s local storage.

Users should protect their device (screen lock/biometrics) and keep the OS up to date.

7) Children

General audio/ informational content. Parental guidance is advised where applicable under local Play policies.

8) Your Rights & Contact

For any privacy questions, contact [travelsizer.com@gmail.com].
We aim to respond within 7 business days.

9) Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy when necessary. Material changes will be posted here with the updated date.
